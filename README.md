# Pinocchio Guide

This repository was created to support building with Pinocchio.

Feel free to contribute to the repository and optimize the examples and documentation in any way!

## Documentation

- [Guide](GUIDE.md): This file provides a comprehensive explanation of Pinocchio's core functionalities, focusing on system-level operations and instruction calls. It includes examples and best practices for implementing account management functionalities on the Solana blockchain.
  
- [Tutorial](TUTORIAL.md): This file demonstrates how to transform an Anchor-based Vault into a Pinocchio-based Vault. It provides step-by-step instructions for building and optimizing a Vault program, comparing the high-level abstractions of Anchor with the low-level optimizations of Pinocchio.

## Examples

The `examples` folder contains program examples that implement Pinocchio functions. These examples are still a work in progress and may contain errors or incomplete implementations. Contributions to improve these examples are welcome!
